<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a PhD in Applied Mathematics at Columbia University.
My research lies at the intersection of high-dimensional PDEs, scientific computing, stochastic dynamics, and non-equilibrium Markov processes. I build theory-backed algorithms and scale them to high-dimensional experiments.
Here is my [CV](resume/resume.pdf).

# 🔬 Research Experience

**Sharp hypocoercive convergence estimates for nonequilibrium dynamics** — *Jul 2025 – Present*  
Supervisors: [Prof. Jianfeng Lu](https://sites.math.duke.edu/~jianfeng/) (Duke), [Prof. Bowen Li](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/stfprofile/bowenli.htm) (CityU)  
Designed a novel gapped-DMS method for sharp hypocoercive estimate of convergence rate. A preview on underdamped Langevin can be found here ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.10068)). We are building a general nonequilibrium version that establish the square root and perturbation threshold explicitly, and potentially there would also be a time discrete version as well.

**Simulation-Calibrated Algorithm for High-Dimensional PDEs (SCaSML)** — *Jun 2024 – Apr 2025*  
Supervisors: [Prof. Yiping Lu](https://2prime.github.io/) (Northwestern), Dr. Yan Sun (Georgia Tech)  
Proposed SCaSML, a simulation-calibrated pipeline correcting PINN bias via Multilevel Picard-style estimators with provably improved complexity scaling on 100d+ benchmarks. ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16172))

**Continuous-State Contextual Bandit with Pessimism Regularization** — *Aug 2024 – Nov 2025*  
Supervisor: [Prof. Ying Jin](https://ying531.github.io/) (Harvard)  
Extended pessimism regularization to continuous state/action spaces with function approximation, proving regret guarantees without uniform-overlap assumptions.

**Flow-Calibrated Stochastic Control for Transition Path Sampling** — *Feb 2024 – Jun 2024*  
Supervisors: [Prof. Yiping Lu](https://2prime.github.io/) (Courant), [Dr. Dinghuai Zhang](https://zdhnarsil.github.io/) (Mila)  
Reformulated transition-path sampling as stochastic optimal control and developed continuous SAC and GFlowNet variants guided by flow-based calibration.

**Unbiased Square-Root Convergent Estimation for High-Dimensional Semilinear Parabolic PDEs** — *Sep 2023 – Feb 2024*  
Supervisor: [Prof. Yiping Lu](https://2prime.github.io/) (Courant)  
Developed an unbiased estimator combining Multilevel Picard iteration with randomized MLMC, establishing unbiasedness and variance bounds.
